# Ap Phisics calculator

repo of programs i made for my calcuators

as of 5/9/2024 This is a repository of program files I made and compiled for the AP physics test.

this includes two group some build for the ti84 and .py files for the numworks
    if you have the ti84 python the numworks programs might work
-----------------------------------
ti84 folder has:
 set of .8xg files and txt t files
the following was last updated on 5/9
if you improve my file, send them to me so I can add them to the repo and give you credit
this will have functions for:
Circular motion - centripetal acceleration and gravitation
kinematic equation - 3 basic equations, MultiDirectional
MultiDirectional- took it from someone else and lost the original file, couldn't understand it
mechanical energy - Kinetic", "Potential," "Spring" Work," "Power,"
momentum -
torque - taken from someone else, I don't remember who
vector addition -
Waves - things like spring motion periods and oscillations - are taken from someone else. I don't remember who

has three folders -
txt files copy and past of the .8xg
.8xg files to run on the calculator
"not made" collection of files I didn't make but you might find helpful if you can get it to work
-------------------------
numworks has:
to be added later
