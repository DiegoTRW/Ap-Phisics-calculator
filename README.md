# Ap Phisics calculator

repo of programs i made for my calcuators

as of 5/9/2024 This is a repository of program files I made and compiled for the AP physics test.

this includes a set of .8xg files and txt t files
the following was last updated on 5/9
if you improve my file, send them to me so I can add them to the repo and give you credit
this will have functions for:
Circular motion - centripetal acceleration and gravitation
kinematic equation - 3 basic equations, MultiDirectional
MultiDirectional- took it from someone else and lost the original file, couldn't understand it
mechanical energy - Kinetic", "Potential," "Spring" Work," "Power,"
momentum -
torque - taken from someone else, I don't remember who
vector addition -
Waves - things like spring motion periods and oscillations - are taken from someone else. I don't remember who

has three folders -
txt files copy and past of the .8xg
.8xg files to run on the calculator
"not made" collection of files I didn't make but you might find helpful if you can get it to work
